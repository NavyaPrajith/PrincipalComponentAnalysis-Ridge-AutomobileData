In this project, we delve into the complex task of predicting automobile prices using a sophisticated combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ridge regression. Our dataset spans a wide range of attributes crucial to understanding automobile pricing, including make, fuel type, horsepower, and more.

Our primary objective is twofold: first, to effectively reduce the dimensionality of our dataset using PCA while retaining critical information, and second, to construct a robust predictive model for automobile prices using Ridge regression. This dual approach allows us to explore intricate data patterns while mitigating common regression pitfalls.

Our methodology begins with comprehensive dataset preprocessing, addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. We then leverage PCA to transform our dataset into a lower-dimensional space, capturing essential variance. Subsequently, we train a Ridge regression model on the PCA-transformed data to accurately predict automobile prices.

To evaluate our model's performance, we employ standard regression evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. Rigorous cross-validation techniques ensure the reliability and generalization of our model to unseen data.

Insights gleaned from our analysis include examining Ridge regression coefficients to identify influential features driving automobile prices. Additionally, exploring principal components obtained from PCA offers valuable insights into underlying data structures and feature importance.

In conclusion, our project showcases the effectiveness of combining PCA for dimensionality reduction with Ridge regression for predicting automobile prices. By leveraging these advanced techniques, we provide a robust framework for understanding and predicting price dynamics in the automotive industry, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.
